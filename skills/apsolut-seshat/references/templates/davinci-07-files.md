# 07-files — cold binary storage

This folder holds **binaries you want to keep but rarely open**: PDFs, audio (wav/mp3), exports, datasets, design files — anything that isn't markdown.

## how to use

- Organize with subfolders **on demand** — `pdfs/`, `audio/`, `exports/`, `data/`. None exist until you create them.
- Don't dump live codebases here. For comparing/borrowing code, use a git branch or a sibling folder, not `07-files/`.
- Reference a file from anywhere in the notebook with a link, e.g. from [[04-library/]] or [[05-decisions/]]:
  `see [the spec](07-files/pdfs/api-spec.pdf)`.

## git

Contents are gitignored — this `000-template.md` is the only tracked file by default. If a specific binary matters long-term (a signed contract, evidence for a decision), force-add it: `git add -f 07-files/pdfs/contract.pdf`.

<!--
07-files is davinci's cold-storage drop zone — the numbered equivalent of the bare→full `.apsolut/files/`. davinci keeps it numbered so the vault stays an all-numbered notebook. Hot UI/bug images go in 08-screenshots/ instead. Pasted markdown excerpts go in 04-library/, not here.
